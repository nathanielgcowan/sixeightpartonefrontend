[*] Design and architect features across frontend and backend
[*] Integrate JavaScript and Rails
[*] Debug issues in small- to medium-sized projects
[*] Build and iterate on a project MVP
[*] Communicate in a technical environment
[*] Project Deliverables

[*] A link to your project repo with code for your Rails backend and HTML / CSS / JavaScript frontend.
  https://github.com/nathanielgcowan/sixeightpartonefrontend
[*] A README.md file describing your application
  check
[] A Blog Post about your application
[] A 2-4 minute Video Demo introducing your application

[*] The application must be an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend with a Rails API backend.
[*] All interactions between the client and the server must be handled asynchronously (AJAX) and use JSON as the communication format.

[*] The backend and frontend must collaborate to demonstrate Client-Server Communication. Your application should have at  least 3 AJAX calls,

[*] covering at least 2 of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD).
[*] Your client-side JavaScript code must use fetch with the appropriate HTTP verb, and your Rails API should use RESTful conventions.

JavaScript
[*] Use classes and functions to organize your code into reusable pieces.
[*] Translate JSON responses into JavaScript model objects using ES6 class or constructor function syntax.
[*] Use ES6 features when appropriate (e.g. arrow functions, let & const, rest and spread syntax).
Rails
[*] Follow Rails MVC and RESTful conventions. That means, for example, that a request GET /puppies ought to be handled by the PuppiesController, fetch puppies from the database using a Puppy Active Record model, and return a list of puppies as JSON.
[*] Well-named variables and methods
[*] Short, single-purpose methods
Git
[*] Aim for a large number of small commits - commit frequently!
[*] Add meaningful messages to your commits. When you look back at your commits with git log, the messages should describe each change.
[*] Don't include changes in a commit that aren't related to the commit message

[] You must submit a link to the repo with the code for your project.
[*] There is no requirement for how you decide to structure the code within that repo, but in the past, students have had success using a structure like:
  javascript-project/
    backend/
      app/
      (...other rails files and folders)****
    frontend/
      index.html
      style.**css**
      index.js
    README.md

Learning Goals

[*] Use render json: to render serialized JSON
[*] Select, Create, and Modify DOM nodes
[*] Attach listeners to DOM nodes to respond to user interaction
[*] Use preventDefault to control form submit behavior
[*] Use fetch with 'GET', 'POST', 'PATCH' & 'DELETE' HTTP methods
[*] Instantiate JavaScript objects and call methods on them.
